### Tools/Libraries Used: Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, MatplotLib, Pandas, NumPy

A combination of these tools and a Kaggle provided dataset allowed me to create a regression model that helps predict the price of a bulldozer given certain parameters. (Further details are outlined within the notebook)
